# C++ Source Code of Token2 TOTP Hardware Tokens

## Introduction

This repository contains the C++ source code used in some of our hardware tokens (classic, single profile TOTP tokens). The code provided here serves as a generalized framework for implementing functionality on hardware tokens. It does not include hardware-specific aspects such as compiling and uploading instructions, as those vary depending on the chip manufacturer's specifications.

## Disclaimer
The code provided in this repository is for demonstration purposes only. It is not intended for production use without thorough testing and customization to meet specific requirements. The authors and contributors of this code are not responsible for any damages or issues arising from its use.
